# Teisha's README Generator
    This Professional README Generator allows users to create a README file directly from their command line! 

    ## Installation
    Clone my github repository to your machine and open the associated files in your IDE. Open your command line via your IDE. Run npm install. Then run node index.js to get started.

    ## Usage
    This generator would be great for users who want to quickly create a README file without leaving their IDE. The tool is convenient and presents a user with specific questions that, if answered, will insure that they have created a professional README file.
